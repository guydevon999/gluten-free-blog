            <h2>Why do some people avoid gluten?</h2>
            <p>
                People might avoid eating gluten for various reasons, most commonly due to health concerns such
                as celiac disease, which causes an autoimmune reaction to gluten and can lead to serious digestive
                and systemic issues. Others might have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which can result in symptoms
                like bloating, fatigue, and headaches even without the autoimmune response. Additionally, some
                individuals choose to avoid gluten as part of a broader trend towards gluten-free diets, which they
                believe might offer health benefits or contribute to overall wellness. For many, avoiding gluten has
                become a personal or lifestyle choice aimed at improving their quality of life or addressing specific
                health concerns.
            </p>
            <h2>What gluten is and how to avoid it</h2>
            <p>
                Gluten is a group of proteins found primarily in wheat, barley, and rye that gives dough its elasticity
                and helps it rise. It is commonly present in a variety of foods, including bread, pasta, and baked
                goods, as well as in some processed foods where it may act as a thickening or stabilizing agent. To
                avoid gluten, individuals should eliminate these grains and their derivatives from their diet. This
                involves choosing gluten-free alternatives such as rice, quinoa, and gluten-free oats, and carefully
                reading food labels to identify hidden sources of gluten. Additionally, many specialty products and
                restaurants now offer gluten-free options to cater to those with dietary restrictions.
